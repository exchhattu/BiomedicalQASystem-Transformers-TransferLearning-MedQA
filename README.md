# MedQA - an automated question answer system
Aritifical intelligence in health create aims to ease a task easy and fast. In
addition, it can also provide integrated platform to connect professionals who
are in the system such as doctors, patients, scientists,  One
of tasks could be to design the automated system in which doctor can find
relevant records in patient note. Similar technology also can be used by other
medical professional such as researchers, clinicians, and pharamacists to get
an answer quickly. 

## Requirements:
* Python version 3.0+
* NumPy
* Pandas
* PyTorch
* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
* [PyTorch-Transformers](https://github.com/rusiaaman/pytorch-transformers) 


## Motivation:
* Design automated question answering system for health care domain.
* Implement transfer learning to understand how generic pretrained model can be
  use in different domain. 
* Fine-tune generic models trained on large corpus for specific downstream
  goal. 

## Goal: 
* AI in
