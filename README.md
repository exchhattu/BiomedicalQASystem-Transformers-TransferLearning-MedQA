# MedQA - an automated medical question answer system
Aritifical intelligence in health create aims to ease a task easy and fast. In
addition, it can also provide integrated platform to connect professionals who
are in the system such as doctors, patients, scientists, and others. One
of tasks could be to design the automated system in which doctor can find
relevant records in patient note quickly. Similar technology also can be used by other
medical professional such as researchers, clinicians, and pharamacists to get
an answer quickly. 

## Requirements:
* Python version 3.0+
* NumPy
* Pandas
* PyTorch
* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
* [PyTorch-Transformers](https://github.com/rusiaaman/pytorch-transformers) 


## Motivation:
* Design automated question answering system for health care domain.
* Implement transfer learning to understand how generic pretrained model can be
  use in different domain. 
* Fine-tune generic models trained on large corpus for specific downstream
  goal. 

## Goal: 
* Design a platform for the medical professionals, where they can find the answer question 
  from relevant documents, to ease their task.  

## Data and pre-trained model
* [BioASQ Data](https://github.com/dmis-lab/bioasq-biobert)
* [XLnet](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet) permutation language model
